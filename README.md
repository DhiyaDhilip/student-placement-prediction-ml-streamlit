# student-placement-prediction-ml-streamlit
Machine learning classification project to predict student placement outcomes using Random Forest. Includes EDA, feature engineering, model evaluation based on accuracy, and deployment as an interactive Streamlit web application with Joblib model saving.

#  Student Placement Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will get placed based on academic and skill-related features using supervised machine learning classification.

##  Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing student placement
- Build an accurate classification model
- Deploy the model for real-time prediction

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Joblib
- Streamlit

##  Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training using Random Forest Classifier  
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score  
6. Model saving using Joblib  
7. Streamlit deployment  

##  Model Performance
- Achieved high accuracy on test data
- Model performance validated using accuracy metric
